	<p><b><ul><u>You might be wondering why I would be interested in application building, web development& cyber security</u></ul> All these three skills are really fundamental in computer science because if
	whatever my future goal is to be if I'm gonna choose web development as my future career or application building or the cyber ,the other two skills that I have learned are gonna
	support the primary skills <br><br>for example if I wanna choose application building as my primary goal then I'm gonna build applications  easily and more advanced and I'm gonna 
	advertise it on my own website and also I'm gonna give protection to my website as well as my application using cybersecurity skills so it's gonna be really useful for me.<br><br>cyber
	security  teaches me about networking how computers interact with each other so it's gonna be easy for me To properly understand System and the stuff so it's gonna be really 
	helpful for me to know how the mobile system works and what my application i will be build on. Ofcourse they are gonna be something related to the web system like it's a browser or it's gonna be
	a security software such as antivirus or Wi-Fi security or something related to cyber security<br><br> My application is gonna be based on web and cyber security.<br><br>
	And the web development is gonna help me in two different ways because I can deeply understand how the website works and that's gonna help me to well protect with my cyber security
	skills and also publish my application or I can just build websites for other users who are interested to publish their application so it's gonna be a good deal either way.</b></p>
